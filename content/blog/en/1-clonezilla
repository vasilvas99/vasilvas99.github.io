title: Migrating Windows to a new SSD with Clonezilla

Recently I have found myself lacking space on my system drive. Luckily fast NVMe M.2 are cheap now.
Not so luckily, my system has a single M.2 slot and my Windows installation has so much configured/
installed just _the way I like it_ that I could not fathom the thought of throwing it all away and 
starting from scratch. (Yeah, yeah I know, backups and stuff.)

So, the high-level solution was somewhat obvious - dump the drive to an image on my SATA Hard Drive that has plenty of space, swap SSDs, flash the image. 

Of course your drive `C:\` on Windows is only _one_ of the partitions that Windows creates during 
its installation, in my case in total my SSD had 4 partitions. Soo now I have to not only create/flash
the image but recreate the partition table manually and `dd` each of those partitions separately. The thought of so much manual work was just unbearable.

## Enter Clonezilla

Here are the basic steps for migrating (images)

1. Download the ISO from the [Clonezilla website](https://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=alternative) and create a bootable USB with [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) for example.
