Hi, I am Vasil - a Masters's student in Computational mathematics with a Bachelor's in Physical and
Theoretical Chemistry.

My hobby (mostly) work has been in Crystal Growth modeling, with some papers currently sent for publication.
To see what scientific works I have participated in, check my [ORCID Page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7651-2462)

Otherwise, my day job is as a [Commiter](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/vasilvas99) for the [Eclipse Leda Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.leda) - a FOSS 
project for a Software-Defined Vehicle Linux-based OS backed by my employer Robert Bosch GmbH. 

Mainly, I dabble in Rust, Python, C++, and Bash for work, though when it comes to numerical programming for modeling purposes, nothing can beat good ol' Fortran (except Julia, I suppose ðŸ™‚). 
I also think I am decent at Wolfram Mathematica, especially at the ODE/PDE/symbolic math parts.

I intrested in various Mathematics topics (dynamic systems, scaling behavior of PDEs, FEM, PDEs, etc.), which, when I have free time, I like to mess with/explore.

The purpose of this blog is to be more of a collection of notes and thoughts on all of those math/physics/chem/tech topics, so feel free to explore (if I've gotten around to posting some content).


Here are socials again, though they are in the footer of  this website anyway:
