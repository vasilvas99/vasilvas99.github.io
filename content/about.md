Hi, I'am Vasil - a Masters student in Computational mathematics with a Bachelors in Physical and
Theoretical Chemistry.

My hobby (mostly) work has been in Crystal Growth modelling with some papers currently sent for publication.
To see what scientific works I have participated in, check my [Orcid Page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7651-2462)

Otherwise, my day job is as a [Commiter](https://accounts.eclipse.org/users/vasilvas99) for the [Eclipse Leda Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.leda) - a FOSS 
project for a Software-Defined Vehicle Linux-based OS, backed by my employer Robert Bosch GmbH. 

Mainly, I dabble in Rust, Python, C++ and Bash for work, though when it comes to numerical programming for modelling purposes nothing can beat good ol' Fortran (except Julia I suppose ðŸ™‚).


I have interest in various Mathematics topics (dynamic systems, scaling behaviour of PDEs, FEM, PDEs, etc.), which when I have free time I like to mess with/explore.

The purpose of this blog is to be more of a collection of notes and thoughts on all of those math/phyics/chem/tech topics, so feel free to explore (if I've gotten around to post some content).


Enough for this first about page for now. Here are socials again, though they are in the footer of 
this webiste anyway:
