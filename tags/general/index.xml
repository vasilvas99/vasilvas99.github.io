      <description>Recently I have found myself lacking space on my system drive. Luckily large, fast NVMe M.2 SSDs are cheap now. Not so luckily, my system has a single M.2 slot, and my Windows installation has so much configured/installed just the way I like it that I could not fathom the thought of throwing it all away and starting from scratch. (Yeah, yeah, I know, backups and stuff.)
So, the high-level solution was somewhat obvious - dump the drive to an image on my SATA Hard Drive that has plenty of space, swap SSDs, and flash the image.</description>
