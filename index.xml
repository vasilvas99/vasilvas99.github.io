My hobby (mostly) work has been in Crystal Growth modeling, with some papers currently sent for publication. To see what scientific works I have participated in, check my ORCID Page
Otherwise, my day job is as a Commiter for the Eclipse Leda Project - a FOSS project for a Software-Defined Vehicle Linux-based OS backed by my employer Robert Bosch GmbH.</description></item><item><title>Migrating Windows to a new SSD with Clonezilla</title><link>https://severely.online/blog/en/1-clonezilla/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://severely.online/blog/en/1-clonezilla/</guid><description>Recently I have found myself lacking space on my system drive. Luckily large, fast NVMe M.2 SSDs are cheap now. Not so luckily, my system has a single M.2 slot, and my Windows installation has so much configured/installed just the way I like it that I could not fathom the thought of throwing it all away and starting from scratch. (Yeah, yeah, I know, backups and stuff.)
So, the high-level solution was somewhat obvious - dump the drive to an image on my SATA Hard Drive that has plenty of space, swap SSDs, and flash the image.</description></item></channel></rss>
