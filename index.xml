      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;am Vasil - a Masters student in Computational mathematics with a Bachelors in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry.
My hobby (mostly) work has been in Crystal Growth modelling with some papers currently sent for publication. To see what scientific works I have participated in, check my Orcid Page
Otherwise, my day job is as a Commiter for the Eclipse Leda Project - a FOSS project for a Software-Defined Vehicle Linux-based OS, mainly backed by my employer Robert Bosch GmbH.</description>
